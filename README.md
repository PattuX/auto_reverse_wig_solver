# Auto Reverse Wherigo Solver
Find all Reverse Wherigos in a .gpx file and write their final coordinates to the .gpx

# Usage

```py wig_solver.py <gpx-file>```

Currently this overwrites the gpx file. The old .gpx will be lost in the process. I'd recommend saving a copy of your .gpx somewhere in case something goes wrong.
